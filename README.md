This is an internship assignment given by Quixote.

Tech Stack Used:
1. Python-Flask (to create APIs).
1. MongoDB (For Database).



Let us discuss how to use this api :

1. Searching a book

    a. Searching a book by its name or a term in the book's name :
        Type in the url bar = "https://the-bookslibrary.herokuapp.com/search/book_name_term"
        
        Replace "book_name_term" with book's name or term.
    
    b. Searching a book by its author name :
        Type in the url bar = "https://the-bookslibrary.herokuapp.com/search/author_name"
    
        Replace "author_name" with book's author name.
    
    c. Searching a book by its category :
        Type in the url bar = "https://the-bookslibrary.herokuapp.com/search/category_term>"
    
        Replace "category_term" with book's category.
    
    d. Searching a book by its rent :
        Type in the url bar = "https://the-bookslibrary.herokuapp.com/search/with-rent/rent_amount"
    
        Replace "rent_amount" with book's rent amount.
    
    e. Searching a book by a range of rent :
        Type in the url bar = "https://the-bookslibrary.herokuapp.com/search/with-rent-range/low-high"
    
        Replace "low" with lowest amount of range.
        Replace "high" with highest amount of range.
    

2. Issuing a book

    Type in the url bar = "https://the-bookslibrary.herokuapp.com/transactions/issue-book/bookName/personName/issueDate"
    
    Replace "bookName" with book's name.
    Replace "personName" with your name.
    Replace "issueDate" with current date or with the book's issuing date (date format : YYYY-MM-DD).



3. Returning a book

    Type in the url bar = "https://the-bookslibrary.herokuapp.com/transactions/return-book/bookName/personName/returnDate"
    
    Replace "bookName" with book's name.
    Replace "personName" with your name.
    Replace "returnDate" with current date or with the book's returning date (date format : YYYY-MM-DD).



4. To find the usage of a specifc book

    Type in the url bar = "https://the-bookslibrary.herokuapp.com/usage/issued/bookName"
    
    Replace "bookName" with book's name.
    This will return you two things :
        a. List of people who have issued that book
        b. List of people who currently have that book issued



5. To find the total rent generated by a specifc book

    Type in the url bar = "https://the-bookslibrary.herokuapp.com/usage/total-rent-generated/bookName"
    
    Replace "bookName" with book's name.
    This will return you the total rent generated by the specified book till date.



6. To find list of books issued to a particular person

    Type in the url bar = "https://the-bookslibrary.herokuapp.com/person-info/personName"
    
    Replace "personName" with person's name.
    This will return you the list of the books issued by the specified person.



7. To find list of books issued to a particular person

    Type in the url bar = "https://the-bookslibrary.herokuapp.com/book-issued/date-range/fromDate/toDate"
    
    Replace "fromDate" with the date from which you want to find the list of books issued (date format : YYYY-MM-DD).
    Replace "toDate" with the date to which you want to find the list of books issued (date format : YYYY-MM-DD).
